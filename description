Client:
The client initiates a connection to the server by creating a socket object by making use of the socket module. The connection between the client and server is made by specifying the host IPv4 address and the creation of a randomized port number. On establishment of the connection, the client receives a welcome message from the server. The client receives the questions from the server by using a for-loop and decodes the question from byte to string format, using the decode() function of the socket module. The client then has up to 5 seconds to answer the question. If the client fails to answer within the specified time, or answers incorrectly, he doesn’t receive any points for the question. Else his score his incremented. The client’s response is encoded from string to byte using the encode() function of the socket modules and sent to the server. At the end of the quiz, the client receives his score.
